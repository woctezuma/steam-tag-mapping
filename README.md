# Steam Tag Mapping

This repository contains code to compute a mapping of Steam tags, based on an analysis of all Steam games and their respective tags.

## Definition ##

A "tag" is a word or expression attached to a game, as can be seen [on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com//tag/browse).

## Data source ##

The data comes from from [SteamSpy API](http://steamspy.com/api.php).

To run the code, you will need:
* data from SteamSpy: `steamspy.json` (automatically downloaded if the file is missing)

The data is included along the code in this repository, as downloaded on June 30, 2017.

## Requirements ##

This code is written in Python 3.

[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is required for an optimization procedure (which can be skipped if you manually input a value for the parameter `alpha`).
To install these on Windows, I suggest you download the binaries linked to the IntelÂ® Math Kernel Library:
* [NumPy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)
* [SciPy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy)

## Usage ##
1. `download_json.py` downloads data from SteamSpy,
2. `map_tags.py` creates the mapping by analyzing the joint occurences of tags for each game.

## Results ##
* [a NeoGAF post](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=242518836&postcount=7182) showing the map of tags.
